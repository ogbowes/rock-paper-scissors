A game of rock, paper, scissors played with the computer using JavaScript currently in the console. This is the first JavaScript project with The Odin Project.

Skills demonstrated:

- Basic JavaScript syntax and functionality (creating variables, functions, loops, if-else, switch, printing to the console, ? conditional operator)
- Using logical statements and random numbers to create a simple, dynamic game
- Using return values to pass to other functions
- Using return values of functions to keep track of a state (in this case, to ultimately determine the winner of a game of rock, paper, scissors)
